```

## Notes

### Scoping Operations

The `init`, `lint`, `docs`, `scorecards`, and `delete-gha-logs` targets support both global and scoped operations.

By default, all repositories (as defined in [github.mk](./make/configs/github.mk)) will be targeted.

An operation may be scoped to a single repository by setting the `repository` argument:

```shell
make init repository=<repository>
```

### Colored Output

Colorized CLI output may be disabled by setting the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to any non-empty value.

```shell
export NO_COLOR=1 && make
```
